# Running MapReduce on AWS
In this assignment, we aimed at running big data operations on AWS EC2 instances using  Hadoop and Spark.
Then we compared the execution time of both algorithm on a Wordcount program.
We have also implemented a friend recommendation algorithm using Mapreduce in Hadoop. The idea is that if two people have a lot of mutual friends, then the system should recommend that they connect with each other.
